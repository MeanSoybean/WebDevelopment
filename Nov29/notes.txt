Last week: Load data list from SQL db

Finishing up on CRUD from last week
Categories(ID [autoinc], CategoryName)
we add a button to create by going to the index.hbs (handlebars) in the vwCategory folder
we add a anchor button tag with sone black magic component name i don't really understand b4-button something
in the anchor tag we put an image tag with a plus sign and then after it we give it Add Category text

Note: it's best to change common appearance of elements by assigning them reusable classes which have already-defined CSS descriptions

the add button hrefs to /admin/categories/add
we already have the UI for the add screen
we need to hook it up to the /admin/categories/add GET endpoint
we open the controller at category.route.js

router.get('/add', async function (req, res) {
	res.render('vwCategory/add') // render vwCategory/add
})

Note: hbs (Handlebars) files look a lot like HTML files to me
usually he likes to duplicate from his about.hbs html file because there's not much on it

adding a form: duplicate the form HTML template from Bootstrap 4 at https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/forms/

he uses the class fa-4 check selector or something to get a button with an image
i wonder what that is, probably was shown in a previous class

he adds a b4-button-link
basically a lot of r√¢u ria to complete the Add page display-wise

autofocus and placeholder

buttons and inputs must be descendants of the same form tag for its info to be submittable
now we have a <form method="post"> and no action attribute
note: action attribute specifies the URL, NOT PAGE, to send data to. no action attribute means uses the current URL

https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html
https://expressjs.com/en/starter/basic-routing.html

we need to add a router.post in the category.route.js controller to handle at the /add screen
router.post('/add', async function (req, res) {
	console.log('abc')
	res.render('vwCategory/add') // render vwCategory/add
})

TODO: understand how router.post and router.get work, does it need to receive a async function?



now we need to pass the info from the form into express
app.use(express.urlencoded({
	extended: true
}));
this makes the request message's body to be whatever inputs have sent, each input's key is its name attribute (not ID)
and change in the post request to console.log(req.body)


let's look at knexjs cheat sheet for our insert query

knex('users').insert({email: "h1@example.com"})

you can also chain knex.insert's return result with returning() and then toString() it to print



now in router.post:

const category = {
	CatName: req.body.txtCatName
}
const ret = await categoryService.add(category) // returns the ID of the added record
console.log(ret)

must have await when calling in async function?
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Promises

now we make the R and U in CRUD, the Details and Edit-Me view of a given selected item
get the item's ID

first we make it so that "pressing the pencil on an item will take us to the edit page address"
something like /admin/categories/edit?id={{CatId}}"
{{}} is known as escape string template syntax, helps us not hard code URL or string values

router.get('edit', async function(req, res) {
	const id = req.query.id || 0;
	const category = await.categoryService.findById(id);
	if (category===null)
		return res.redirect('/admin/categories');
	res.render('vwCategory/edit',{
		category: category
	});
})

now we edit our category.service class

async findById(id) {
	const list = await db('categories').whereID('CatID', id);
	if (list.length === 0) {
		return null;
	}
	return list[0];
}

in our form, because we have two different buttons with two different behaviors: Saving and Update
we will need to send them to different addresses (URL endpoints)
for saving an edit: admin/categories/patch
router.post('/patch', async function(req, res) {
	await categoryService.patch(req.body);
})

in categoryService
patch(entity) {
	const id = entity.CatID
	delete entity.CatID; // this deletes the CatID field from entity object
	// this makes it so that we can pass entity into update and have it work because update won't try to set CatID anymore
	
	knex('categories').where({CatID: id}).update(entity);
}

for delete: admin/categories/del
router.post('/del', async function(req, res) {
	const id = req.body.CatID;
	await categoryService.del(id);
	res.redirect('admin/categories');
})

in categoryService
del(id) {
	knex('categories').where({CatID: id}).del()
}



input validation: alert/error user with js to get confirmation to delete




////////
view products sorted by category
in product-user.route.js 
router.get('/byCat/:id', async function(req, res) {
	const id = req.params.id || 0;
	const list = await productService.findByCatId(id);
	res.render('vwProduct/byCat', {
		products: list,
		empty: list.length === 0
	});
})

in product.service.js
findByCatId(id) {
	return db('products').where('CatID', id);
}



need to put images in
folder structure:
	public
		imgs
			sp
				1
					main.jpg
					main_thumbs.jpg
				2
					...
				...

need to make these pictures accessible by exposing it via the controller in Express
app.use('/public', express.static('public'))





//// want to modify a value that would be put on view engine

put a function in the view engine
app.engine('hbs',engine({
	helpers: {
		format_number(val) {
			return val - 20000;
		}
	}
}


to display data that's already html
use triple {{{ }}}
whereas {{ }} will reencode it to safe string (like < becomes &lt;)
