                            <abbr title="Question">Q:</abbr>    <b>What are game engines?</b><br>
                            <abbr title="Answer">A:</abbr>    A game engine is a software framework primarily designed for the development of video games, and generally includes relevant libraries and support programs. The "engine" terminology is similar to the term "software engine" used in the software industry.<br><br>

                            Game engine can also refer to the development software utilizing this framework, typically offering a suite of tools and features for developing games.<br><br>
                            
                            Developers can use game engines to construct games for video game consoles and other types of computers. The core functionality typically provided by a game engine may include a rendering engine ("renderer") for 2D or 3D graphics, a physics engine or collision detection (and collision response), sound, scripting, animation, artificial intelligence, networking, streaming, memory management, threading, localization support, scene graph, and video support for cinematics. Game engine implementers often economize on the process of game development by reusing/adapting, in large part, the same game engine to produce different games or to aid in porting games to multiple platforms.<br>

                            <abbr title="Answer">A:</abbr>    The web is a distributed service which provides multimedia information based on hypertext documents. <b>Distributed</b> as in the source of the information is spread across multiple <i>servers</i> around the world. <b>Multimedia</b> as in the information comes in various forms, such as text, images, audio, video. <b>Hypertext</b> is text displayed on a computer display or other electronic devices with references to other text that the reader can immediately access. Hypertext documents are interconnected by hyperlinks, which are typically activated by a mouse click, keypress set, or screen touch.<br>

                            <abbr title="Answer">A:</abbr>    IP stands for Internet Protocol, a set of rules that govern how communicating across the Internet works. Loosely speaking, an IP address identifies a destination on the Internet to send data to and from. IPv4 has 32bits of data, segmented into four 8-bit numbers.<br>

                            <abbr title="Answer">A:</abbr>    A domain name is an easy to write text that identifies a company's or a service's website on the Internet, as opposed to using an IP address. DNS servers store a mapping between the domain name and the actual IP address that it maps to.<br>

It also contains information for Web browsers to render a Web page. A Web page consists of HTML tags which structure the data throughout a Web page, and the actual content itself to be structured.<br>
