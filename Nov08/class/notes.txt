javascript can be run on the
	client: to do rendering, animations, input validations
	server: to generate HTML templating
	
this shares processing in a web app

embedding javascript into html
<script type="text/javascript">
	raw javascript source can  go in here
</script>

you can also just use a source
<script src="bla.js"></script>

The browser will execute <script> as it loads the web page from top to bottom

Putting script in head will run the script as soon as the page is loaded
Putting script in body will run after head is done loading

Event-Driven Programming with JavaScript:
Some HTML objects have event handlers.
onClick, onFocus, onHover, onBlur,
onMouseOver, onMouseOut, onMouseDown, onMouseUp, 
onLoad, onSubmit, onResize

The following syntax:
<tag eventHandler="javascript code goes here">
will execute the javascript code string when eventHandler's event is fired
on the given HTML tag

For example:
<input type="button" name="btnClickMe" value="OpenNewPage"
		onClick="window.open('https://www.google.com');">

Describes a button named btnClickMe with the display text OpenNewPage
that will open Google's homepage when clicked on.

How do we know window.open does that?
See more about the Document Object Model API for opening a here:

You can also bind a function to an event of an object in the DOM in Javascript
window.onload = MethodName


the alert(string) function makes the browser send an alert
this is helpful for printing messages


Some DOM objects:
window
	The window object represents an open window in a browser.
	If a document contain frames (<iframe> tags),
	the browser creates one window object for the HTML document,
	and one additional window object for each frame.
	
	<iframe> is used to embed another HTML document in the same HTML document
	
	properties
		document, event, history, location, name, etc.
	methods
		alert
		confirm
		prompt
document
	The document object is the root node of the HTML document.
	The document object is a property of the window object.
	The document object is accessed with
	window.document or just document
	
	properties
		body
		URL
		childNodes[]
		documentElement
	
	methods
		close
		open
		createTextNode("text")
		createElement("HTMLtag")
		getElementById("id")
history, link, form, frame, location, event


DOM Nodes
	the DOM is just a tree
