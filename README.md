# WebDevelopment
 HCMUS Web Development course. Excited to document everything about HTML, CSS, Node.js, and more.

## Recommended Setup
Install [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) on VSCode. Figure out how to use it yourself ;0

Or install Node.js and then run this in your command line to globally install [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server):
```
npm install --global http-server

I also used 
npm install knex -g
npm install mysql2
```
You can run http-server from whichever root folder you want.

http-server will by default open the HTTP server for your website at port 8080, so you can open any web browser and type in the address bar ```localhost:8080``` and it should open any ```index.html``` or ```default.html``` file.

I don't know how VSCode's Live Server works yet.
